    Langley Research Center (LaRC) is located in Hampton, Virginia. LaRC focuses on aeronautical research, although the Apollo lunar lander was flight tested at the facility and a number of high-profile space missions were planned and designed on site. LaRC was the original home of the Space Task Group.

    Ames Research Center (ARC) Moffett Field was established on December 20, 1939. The center was named after Joseph Sweetman Ames, a founding member of NACA. ARC is one of NASA's 10 major field centers and is located in California's Silicon Valley. Historically, Ames was founded to conduct wind tunnel research on the aerodynamics of propeller-driven aircraft; but has expanded its role in research and technology in aviation, spaceflight, and information technology. Provides leadership in astrobiology, small satellites, robotic lunar exploration, intelligent/adaptive systems, and thermal protection.

    The George W. Lewis Center's core competencies include air breathing and in-space propulsion and cryogenics, communications, power energy storage and conversion, microgravity sciences, and advanced materials.

    The Hugh L. Dryden Flight Research Facility (AFRC), established by NACA before 1946, is located at Edwards AFB and includes a Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) designed and modified to carry the Space Shuttle orbiter to Kennedy Space Center after landing at Edwards AFB. (eng: Shuttle Carrier Aircraft) home. On January 16, 2014, the center was renamed in honor of Neil Armstrong, the first astronaut to walk on the Moon.

    Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in the San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles County, CA, is headquartered in La Ca√±ada Flintridge with a postal address of Pasadena. JPL is managed by the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The laboratory's primary function is the construction and operation of robotic planetary spacecraft, but it also conducts Earth orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.

    Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) at Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Alabama, is one of NASA's largest centers. MSFC is where the Saturn V rocket and Skylab were developed.

    Marshall is NASA's lead center for International Space Station (ISS) design and assembly; The payloads, associated crew training, Space Shuttle propulsion, and external tank and missions were handled here. It included the Launch Operations Directorate, which moved to Florida beginning in December 1959 and became the Launch Operations Center on July 1, 1962.

    Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), located in Greenbelt, Maryland, was founded by NASA on March 1, 1959. It is the largest combined organization of scientists and engineers in the United States dedicated to increasing knowledge of the Solar System, Universe, and Earth through observations from space. GSFC is a major US laboratory for developing and operating unmanned scientific spacecraft. GSFC also operates two spaceflight tracking and data acquisition networks (the Space Network and the Near Earth Network), develops advanced space and earth science data information systems, and satellite systems for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

    The John C. Stennis Space Center, originally the "Mississippi Test Facility", is located in Hancock County, Mississippi, along the Pearl River, on the Mississippi-Louisiana border. This facility, which entered service on October 25, 1961, was NASA's largest rocket engine test facility until the end of the Space Shuttle program. It is currently used for rocket testing by more than 30 local, state, national, international, private and public companies and agencies. Includes the NASA Shared Services Center.

    The Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) is the NASA center for human spaceflight training, research, and flight control. Founded on November 1, 1961, the facility is a 100-building complex constructed between 1962 and 1963 on 1,620 acres (656 ha) of land donated by Rice University in Houston, Texas. The center grew out of the Space Task Group, which was created shortly after NASA was founded to coordinate the U.S. human spaceflight program. It is home to the United States Astronaut Corps and is responsible for astronaut training for the United States and its international partners, and is home to Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Includes Mission Control Center. The center was renamed on February 19, 1973, in honor of U.S. president and Texan Lyndon B. Johnson.

    The John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), west of Cape Canaveral Space Force Base in Florida, is one of NASA's best-known facilities. Named the "Launch Operations Center" at the time of its establishment on July 1, 1962, it was renamed in honor of the late U.S. president on November 29, 1963, and has been the launch site for every United States human spaceflight since 1968. Although such flights were suspended, the facility hosted rocket launches within the scope of the American civil space program.

    KSC continues to manage and operate unmanned rocket launch facilities for America's civilian space program from three platforms at Cape Canaveral. The Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) is the world's fourth largest structure by volume and was the largest when completed in 1965. A total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011. Approximately 2,100 people were federal government employees, the rest were contractors.

    Other facilities include Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia; Michoud Assembly Plant in New Orleans, Louisiana; White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Deep Space Network stations, Barstow, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.

    NASA-owned facilities perform construction, research and communications activities. Some facilities may have more than one event due to historical or administrative reasons. NASA also maintains a short rail line at the Kennedy Space Center and two custom-built Boeing 747s to transport space shuttles.
