    NasaModel(infoName: "Medicine in Space", image: "medicene", title: "Various researches about medicine in space are being carried out. Among these, Advanced Diagnostics with Microgravity Ultrasound research stands out. In the research, astronauts are expected to perform ultrasound scans with the commands they receive from the world and solve health problems that may occur in space. It is difficult to diagnose any medical problem since there is usually no doctor on the International Space Station. Astronauts are exposed to various health risks in space, such as injury from space trauma, barotrum, muscle and bone loss, sleep disturbance, and radiation injury. Ultrasound plays a unique role in space in identifying such problems. The techniques learned in this study are applied to professional and Olympic sports injuries. These methods are also taught to non-expert operators such as medical and high school students. This application can be used in times of disaster or in rural areas where a specialist doctor is difficult to find in the world."),
    NasaModel(infoName: "Depletion of the Ozone Layer", image: "ozon", title: "In 1975, NASA was given the authority and duty to examine the upper atmosphere. In this context, first the Upper Atmosphere Investigation Program and then the Earth Observation System (DGS) was born. DGS satellites observed ozone depletion in the 1990s. The first worldwide comprehensive measurements were made in 1978 with the Nimbus 7 satellite and NASA scientists."),

    Understanding the impacts of nature and humans on the environment on a global scale is the main goal of NASA's earth science programs. Today, NASA examines Earth's systems (oceans, lands, atmosphere, biosphere, cryosphere) from every angle with more than ten spacecraft and probes in orbit. More satellites are planned to be launched for these tasks in the coming years.

    NASA is working with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to produce a high-detail map of global solar energy resources. It also works with the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Department of Energy and the United States Air Force to remove hazardous waste materials. These agencies were given permission to use the John F. Kennedy base with an agreement signed on April 6, 1996, to conduct the necessary tests.

    On May 8, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized NASA for the first time as the federal agency that produces energy from landfill gas. NASA carried out this application at Goddard Space Flight Center.
