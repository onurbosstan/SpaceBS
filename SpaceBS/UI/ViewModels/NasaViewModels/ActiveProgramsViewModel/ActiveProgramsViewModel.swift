        The 2001 Mars Odyssey is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars. The project, which has an estimated cost of $297 million for the entire mission, was developed by NASA and externally contracted to Lockheed Martin. Its mission is to detect evidence of water and ice, past or present, using spectrometers and thermal cameras, as well as to study the planet's geology and radiation environment. It is hoped that the data obtained by Odyssey will help answer the question of whether there is life on Mars and create a risk assessment of radiation that astronauts may be exposed to in the future. It also acts as a relay for communication with Earth between the Curiosity rover and the earlier Mars Exploration Rover and Phoenix lander. It takes its name from the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, written by him and Stanley Kubrick, as a tribute to science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke.

        Odyssey was launched on a Delta II 7925 rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Base Launch Complex 17A on April 7, 2001, and reached Mars orbit at 02:30 UTC on October 24, 2001 (7:30 PM PDT, 10:30 PM EDT on October 23).

        NASA announced on May 28, 2002 (sol 210) that Odyssey's GRS instrument had detected large amounts of hydrogen, a sign that ice must be present within a meter of the planet's surface, and was continuing to map the distribution of water below the shallow surface. The orbiter also discovered enormous deposits of water ice near the surface of equatorial regions.

        As of December 15, 2010, it broke the record for the longest-serving spacecraft on Mars after 3,340 days of activity. Odyssey also served as NASA's main communications vehicle for Mars surface exploration over the last decade, until the Curiosity rover. It is currently the longest survivor in orbit around a planet other than Earth, ahead of the Pioneer Venus Orbiter (which lasted 14 years) and Mars Express (which lasted more than 17 years) at 22 years, 4 months and 1 day. It holds the record for active spacecraft. As of October 2019, it is in a polar orbit with a semimajor axis of approximately 3,800 km (2,400 mi) around Mars. It has enough fuel to operate until 2025.

        Cassiniâ€“Huygens was a joint NASA, ESA, and ASI interplanetary space exploration mission launched on October 15, 1997, to study the Saturn system, including its natural moons and rings.

        It is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to orbit it. The spacecraft, which was launched into space in 1997, after arriving at Saturn in 2004, observed this planet and also Jupiter, examining the heliosphere and many natural satellites for the purpose of relativity theory experiments. The two-piece spacecraft, which takes photographs of the planet, its rings and moons almost every day, collects data and sends them to Earth, takes its name from astronomers Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Christiaan Huygens. Finally, after entering Saturn's rings, capturing and analyzing gas, dust and ice particles and taking high-resolution photographs, its mission is planned to end by entering the planet's atmosphere on September 15, 2017.

        Cassini, which began to be developed in the 1980s, was launched into space on October 15, 1997, with the Titan IVB / Centaur carrier rocket. After 7 years of interplanetary flight, it entered orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. On December 25, 2004, at approximately 02:00 UTC, the Huygens satellite separated from the rover and landed on Titan on January 14, 2005.

        One of his greatest discoveries is that there are large sources of liquid water on Saturn's moons Titan, Enceladus and Mimas, and that these moons could potentially harbor life.[10] NASA Planetary Protection Office, which is concerned about Cassini's mission contaminating these waters that may have life at the end of its mission; Considering that some microorganisms might be present in the Cassini spacecraft because it was not cleaned well enough before being launched from Earth, he decided to crash the spacecraft into Saturn.[10] In line with this decision, Cassini, which made a close pass to Titan on April 22, 2017, took advantage of the gravitational power obtained from this maneuver to make 22 dives between Saturn's upper atmosphere and the rings closest to Saturn, thus obtaining closer information about the rings. planned; The first dive was made on April 26.

        After 22 dives following the first dive, it was dropped into the planet's atmosphere at 13:44 on September 15, 2017, and its mission was terminated, as its fuel was exhausted and to avoid damaging satellites with possible life potential.

The Bradbury landing site was less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the center of the rover's landing target after a journey of 560 million km (350 million mi).

        Mission objectives include investigating the climate and geology of Mars, assessing whether the selected area within Gale crater offers suitable environmental conditions for microbial life (including investigating the role of water), and planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration.

        In December 2012, Curiosity's two-year mission was extended indefinitely, and NASA celebrated the fifth anniversary of the Curiosity rover's landing on August 5, 2017. On August 6, 2022, a detailed summary of the Curiosity rover's achievements over the past decade was published. The rover is currently operational and has been active on Mars for 4,111 sols (4,224 total Earth days or 11 years, 6 months, 23 days) since landing as of February 29, 2024.

        The NASA/JPL Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity Project Team was recognized by the US National Aeronautic Association as "The successful landing of Curiosity on Mars will enhance the nation's technological and engineering capabilities and significantly advance humanity's understanding of the ancient habitable environments of Mars."

        Dawn was a space probe launched by NASA in September 2007 on a mission to study Vesta and Ceres, two of the three known proto-planets of the asteroid belt. In the ninth mission of NASA's Discovery program, the Dawn spacecraft entered Vesta orbit on July 16, 2011, completing a 14-month exploration mission before departing for Ceres in late 2012. It entered orbit of Ceres on March 6, 2015. In 2017, NASA announced that the planned nine-year mission would be extended until the probe's hydrazine fuel supply was exhausted.[13] NASA announced on November 1, 2018 that Dawn had exhausted its hydrazine fuel and the mission was over. The spacecraft is currently orbiting Ceres in an uncontrolled but stable orbit.

        Dawn orbits two extraterrestrial bodies, visiting Vesta and Ceres, and also orbiting a dwarf planet in March 2015, arriving at Ceres a few months before New Horizons, which will fly past Pluto in July of the same year. It was the first spacecraft to enter.

        The Dawn mission was managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory division. NASA's European partners from Italy, Germany, and France contributed to the mission by providing spacecraft parts. This mission was the first NASA exploration mission to use an ion engine, which allowed the spacecraft to orbit and exit two celestial bodies. Previous multi-target missions using chemical engines, such as the Voyager program, were limited to flights only.

    ActiveProgramsModel(programsName: "Hubble", image: "hubble", title: """
        The Hubble Space Telescope (HUT) is named in memory of American astronomer Edwin Hubble; It is a space telescope carried into orbit around Earth by the Space Shuttle Discovery during Mission STS-31 in April 1990. Although it was not the first space telescope, HUT is one of the largest and has many outstanding features. It is also well-known for being both a vital research tool and an effective public relations tool for astronomy.

        HUT is a joint effort between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) and is part of NASA's Great Observatories program, which consists of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, Chandra X-ray Observatory, and Spitzer Space Telescope projects.

        The construction of space telescopes was first considered in 1923. Funding was found for HUT in the 1970s, with the goal of sending it into space in 1983, but the project was delayed by technical delays, budget problems and the Challenger disaster. After it was placed into orbit in 1990, scientists found that the main mirror was misplaced, limiting the telescope's operations. This problem was corrected on a space shuttle flight in 1993.

        Thanks to its location outside the Earth's atmosphere, HUT can have many advantages compared to telescopes on the ground: In addition to obtaining images free from the negative effects of the atmosphere (such as blurring in the image and background pollution caused by light reflected from particles in the air), observation of ultraviolet light trapped by the ozone layer can only be achieved. It is possible this way.

        Following its launch in 1990, it has become one of the most important instruments in the history of astronomy. It has been of great help to astronomers in finding solutions to their basic problems in the field of astrophysics. The Hubble ultra-deep field photograph recorded by the Hubble telescope is the most detailed image ever taken with visible light from the farthest distance. Many Hubble observations have led to many groundbreaking results in the field of astrophysics, such as the most precisely calculated rate of the expansion of the universe.

        HUT is the only telescope designed to be maintained in space by astronauts. Five maintenance flights were carried out, the last of which was in May 2009. The first shuttle flight was carried out in December 1993 to correct Hubble's imaging error. During maintenance flights 2, 3A and 3B, many subsystems were repaired and many observation devices were replaced with more modern and competent ones. However, after the accident of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003, the fifth maintenance flight was canceled for safety reasons. After long discussions, NASA reconsidered its decision and the agency's administrator, Mike Griffin, decided to conduct a shuttle flight for the last time. STS-125 took place in May 2009; Two new devices were installed and numerous repairs were made. New devices and fixes were tested and HUT resumed routine operations in September 2009.

        HUT is expected to operate until the James Webb Space Telescope (JWUT), the successor of HUT, which is planned to be sent into space in 2021 after the maintenance performed on the last flight, starts operating. (JWUT) will have a superior astronomical research program in many respects, but because it will observe in the infrared, it will complement (not replace) Hubble's ability to observe at the visible and ultraviolet scales of the spectrum.

        The International Space Station (ISS, English: International Space Station (ISS)) is a space base placed in low Earth orbit, in other words, a habitable artificial satellite. The first part of the station, which was built by combining modules, was launched in 1998. The structure of the station basically consists of pressurized modules, supporting exoskeleton and solar panels. It is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit. It can be seen with the naked eye when viewed from the earth at suitable times.

        The ISS is a laboratory center that provides a space environment and low gravity environment for experiments. It allows the crew to conduct experiments in biology, physiology, physics, chemistry, astronomy, meteorology and more. The station also provides a very suitable environment for the equipment and systems planned to be used in Moon and Mars missions to be tested in space before use.

        The station, which holds the record for the longest uninterrupted human presence in space, has accommodated space crew for 8,518 days uninterruptedly since the Discovery 1 shuttle arrived at the station on November 2, 2000, and continues to do so. The previous record was held by the Soviet space station Mir with 3644 days. As of January 2024, 276 people from 22 countries have visited the space station.

        The International Space Station program is a joint project by five participating space agencies, including the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Russian Federal Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. Ownership and usage rights of the station are determined by intergovernmental agreements and contracts. The station consists of two parts: the Russian Orbital Sector and the United States Orbital Sector. The orbital altitude of the station varies between 330 km and 435 km. The station uses the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft to increase its altitude, which decreases over time. It makes 15.5 trips around the Earth in one day.

        As a result of the US budget increase, the station's term of office was extended from 2020 to 2024, and it is possible that it will be extended to 2028. It is not yet clear whether countries such as Russia, Germany, France, Japan and Canada, which currently support the project and have announced that they will support the project until 2020, will contribute to this extended budget. The Russian Federal Space Agency has made a proposal to build a new station called OPSEK, using the International Space Station before its retirement. ISS is the ninth station to accommodate personnel built to date. Russia announced that it will leave the International Space Station after 2024.

        NASA announced in January 2022 that the ISS's lifespan will be extended until January 2031, after which it is planned to deorbit using the deorbit module and redirect the remains to a remote region of the South Pacific Ocean.

The telescope's reaction control system (RCS) ran out of fuel after nine and a half years of operation, and NASA announced its decommissioning on October 30, 2018.

        Kepler is designed to scan part of the Earth region of the Milky Way to discover Earth-sized exoplanets in habitable zones and to estimate how many of the billions of stars in the Milky Way have such planets. Kepler's only scientific instrument was a photometer that continuously monitored the brightness of approximately 150,000 main sequence stars in a fixed field of view. This data was transmitted to Earth and analyzed to detect periodic dimming caused by planets passing in front of their parent stars. Only planets whose orbits were seen sideways from Earth could be detected. As of June 16, 2023, Kepler has observed 530,506 stars and detected 2,778 confirmed exoplanets.

        The James Webb Space Telescope (English: James Webb Space Telescope, abbreviated as JWST) is a space telescope for infrared astronomy. It is the most powerful telescope sent into space. Planned as a partial successor to the aging Hubble Space Telescope, it was developed under the leadership of NASA and with support from ESA and CSA. It was launched in December 2021 and entered orbit in January 2022.

        Named after James E. Webb, NASA's director of the Apollo program in 2002, JWST is an infrared telescope equipped with a 6.5-meter-wide gold-plated mirror. This mirror enables him to see 13.5 billion light years away, that is, when the first stars of the universe were formed.

        JWST is a project carried out jointly by 15 different states, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency, under the chairmanship of NASA. Tuned to observe infrared light, this 6.5-meter telescope is placed in orbit almost 1.5 million kilometers from Earth. This distance is four times the distance between the Earth and the Moon.

        Designed as a successor to Hubble in 1995, JWST took a long time to complete and encountered many technical obstacles. When it was launched on December 25, 2021, it was in a tight orbit around the L2 (Lagrange point 2) location, far from the Sun, 1.5 million kilometers beyond the Earth's orbit. The L2 position is the place in space where the gravity of the Sun and the Earth work together to pull an object orbiting the Sun at the same rate as the Earth, allowing it to complete one orbit in a year. So JWST is largely in Earth's shadow; This avoids heat pollution from the Sun and enables the telescope to detect very faint infrared sources in deep space. NASA claims that the telescope can even detect the heat of a bumblebee on the Moon.

It was manufactured by Lockheed Martin Space, managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and most of its scientific instruments were produced by European agencies. The mission was launched on an Atlas V-401 launch vehicle at 11:05:01 UTC on May 5, 2018, and successfully landed on Elysium Planitia on Mars at 19:52:59 UTC on November 26, 2018. InSight operated on Mars for 1440 sols (1480 days; 4 years, 19 days).

        InSight's goals were to place a seismograph called the "Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure" (SEIS) on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior. Additionally, internal heat transfer was measured using a heat sensor called "Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package" (HP3) to study the early geological evolution of Mars. This was intended to provide new understanding of how the Solar System's terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) and Earth's satellite Moon formed and developed.

        The lander was planned to be launched in March 2016. But before launch, a persistent vacuum leak in the CNES-supplied seismograph, known as SEIS, caused NASA to postpone the planned launch to May 2018. When InSight was delayed, the remainder of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin. The problem that occurred in the seismograph during the waiting was resolved, but the cost of 675 million dollars increased to 830 million dollars. With the reuse of the technology in the Phoenix spacecraft, which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, the risks of the mission and the cost of the mission were reduced.

        NASA stated that they plan to put InSight in low-power mode to detect seismic events in July 2022 and continue monitoring the lander throughout the operational period ending in December 2022, as excessive dust accumulated on the solar panels prevented the vehicle from recharging. On December 20, 2022, it was announced that the InSight lander lost communication with Earth on December 15, 2022. It was announced that the mission ended on December 21, 2022

The material, brought back in September 2023, is expected to enable scientists to learn more about the formation and evolution of the Solar System, the early stages of planet formation, and the source of organic compounds that led to the formation of life on Earth. After the completion of the main mission, the spacecraft is planned to make a close pass to the asteroid 99942 Apophis, named OSIRIS-APEX.

        OSIRIS-REx was launched on September 8, 2016, passed by Earth on September 22, 2017, and arrived at Bennu on December 3, 2018. He then analyzed the surface for the next two years to find a suitable place to extract samples.

OSIRIS-REx departed Bennu on May 10, 2021 and returned the sample to Earth on September 24, 2023. He then began his new mission to study 99942 Apophis. The spacecraft will arrive at Apophis in April 2029, when the asteroid is expected to approach Earth.

        101955 Bennu was chosen as the target of the study because it is a "time capsule" from the birth of the Solar System. Bennu has a very dark surface and is classified as a B-type asteroid, a subtype of carbonaceous C-type asteroids. Such asteroids are considered "primitive" because they have undergone little geological change since the time of their formation. In particular, Bennu was chosen due to the presence of pristine carbonaceous material, a key element in organic molecules necessary for life and representative of matter before the formation of the Earth. Organic molecules such as amino acids have previously been found in meteorite and comet samples, indicating that some components necessary for life can be synthesized naturally in space.

        The cost of the OSIRIS-REx mission is approximately US$800 million, excluding the Atlas V launch vehicle cost of US$183.5 million. The OSIRIS-APEX extended mission brought an additional cost of 200 million US dollars. It is the third planetary science mission selected under the New Frontiers program, after Juno and New Horizons, and the principal investigator is Dante Lauretta from the University of Arizona.

        Juno is the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, after the nuclear-powered Galileo orbiter, which orbited from 1995 to 2003. Unlike all previous spacecraft sent to the outer planets, Juno is powered by solar panels, which are commonly used by satellites orbiting the Earth and operating in the inner Solar System, while radioisotope thermoelectric generators are often used for missions to the outer Solar System and beyond. However, the three solar panel blades used for Juno, the largest ever installed on a planetary probe, play an integral role in stabilizing the spacecraft and generating power.
