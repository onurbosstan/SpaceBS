    Beginning in 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) began testing with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1. An artificial satellite launch mission was available for the International Geophysical Year (1957-1958) in the early 1950s. For this, the American Vanguard Project (Project Vanguard) breed. After the Soviet space program launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite in world history, on October 4, 1957, U.S. attention to its own fledgling space efforts increased. Alarmed by this perceived threat to national security and technological leadership (known as the "Sputnik crisis"), the US Congress took swift and effective action. President Dwight D. Eisenhower recommended further retention. The result is a shift in the White House's idea of a union among key interest groups, such as rule-of-thumb scientists, the Pentagon having to adapt to Soviet military success, corporate America looking for new occupations, and those enduring in a powerful new world for those who can expand.

    On January 12, 1958, NACA organized a "Special Committee on Space Technology" chaired by Guyford Stever. On January 14, 1958, NACA Director Hugh Dryden issued "A National Research Program for Space Technology." This new federal agency handled all non-military space activities, while the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was created in February 1958 for the purpose of space technology for military purposes.

    On July 29, 1958, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, establishing NASA. When NASA became operational on October 1, 1958, it incorporated three major research facilities, the Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory, two smaller test facilities, an annual budget of $100 million, and the 43-year-old NACA with 8,000 employees. Additionally, some elements of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and the United States Naval Research Laboratory were incorporated into NASA. German rocket manufacturing technology at the center of Wernher von Braun, now working at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), and the contribution of his team played a key role in the success of NASA's space races with the Soviet Union. American scientist Robert Goddard's earlier political technology also made significant contributions to NASA's success. The United States Air Force's previous research efforts and many of ARPA's early space programs were also transferred to NASA. In December 1958, NASA transferred control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory operated by the California Institute of Technology.
