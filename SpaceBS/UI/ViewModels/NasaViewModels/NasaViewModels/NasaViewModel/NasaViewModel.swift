NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, lit. National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the institution responsible for the space program studies of the United States. It was founded on July 29, 1958 by US President Dwight Eisenhower. As of October 1, 1958, the Department began to operate peacefully in civilian areas rather than for military purposes.

NASA has always guided the USA's space efforts with works such as the Apollo flights to the Moon, the Skylab space station and later the space shuttle. Today, NASA supports the International Space Station and is developing the new Ares I and Ares V landers. In addition to space program studies, long-term civil and military rocket studies are also among NASA's areas of work.
